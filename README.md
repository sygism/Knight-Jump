# Knight Jump <img src="src/icons/kj_icon.png" align="right">

Oh boy. Knight Jump is a platformer game created during a game designs course I took in Uni. It's a short game that features a knight jumping around platforms, trying to
get to the top. The game is powered by the ![Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).
